"# SBA-350-Final_Project" 
This is my capstone project for Per Scholas' Data Engineering bootcamp.
It will test my ETL skills through extracting data from multiple sources(json, Rest API), transforming that data with Spark/Spark SQL, and loading that data to MySQL. It will also test my ability to crete visualizations with that data. All in a terminal app.
